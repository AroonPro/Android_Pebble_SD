Test Cases to be Implemented in Manual or Automated Testing
===========================================================

Note:  These tests are primarily for the Garmin Seizure Detector
- there are some additional things needed for the Pebble version to start up
but those are fairly obvious if they are broken.


1.  App starts and displays main activity provided watch sends one sample
    of data, and responds to request for watch settings when asked.

2  Sending one set of seizure like data, followed by a normal set results
   in a warning.

3  Sending two sets of seizure like data in succession followed by two normal
   sets results in Warning -> Alarm -> Warning -> OK

4  Sending one abnormal heart rate followed by OK results in Warning -> OK

5  Sending two abnormal heart rate followed by 2 OK results in Warning ->
   Alarm-> Warning -> Ok.
