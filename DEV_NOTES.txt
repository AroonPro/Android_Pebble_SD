Graham's Development Notes
==========================

V2.6
- We had a V2.6 started, but I can't remember what it did (but it does include
  the NetworkPassive Datasource that I want).
- Start V2.6_new to add in the changes needed for SMS.
- Merge V2.6_new into V2.6, and resolve conflicts.
- Change the gradle dependencies from 'compile' to 'implementation' to get rid
  of build warnings.
- clean project and re-build.
- Suddenly got an error "com.android.builder.dexing.DexArchiveMergerException: Error while merging dex archives: <lots of .jar files listed>
  The number of method references in a .dex file cannot exceed 64K."
- Added multidex support library to build.gradle dependencies and it seemed to compile....
